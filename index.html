<h1>MINT REST Example</h1>
<p>
    Hello and welcome to the MINT REST demo. This basic JQuery-powered front-end has been designed to showcase how the MINT REST API allows for the creation of simple, streamlined front-ends and user experiences that leverage the unified operator services enabled by the MINT platform.
</p>
<p>
    The following example contains four basic elements:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="createuser.html">An administrative "create user" page</a></li>
    <li><a href="epg.html">A simple user login screen</a></li>
    <li><a href="epg.html">A rudimentary EPG viewer</a></li>
    <li><a href="player.html">A simple video streamer</a></li>
</ol>

<p>
    The basic use cases demonstrated with this appliance are that of an administrator creating a new user, that user logging in, browsing the EPG, and viewing a show.
</p>
<p>
    This sample code has been designed to be as simple as possible, using only a standard REST library to keep things streamlined. The "spaghetti" code was purposely written to ease semantic review. This code <b>SHOULD NOT</b> be deployed to a production environment under any circumstances; it is strictly for education purposes only.
